# Facebook Page ID Finder (Chrome Extension)
The Facebook Page ID Finder is a simple Chrome extension that allows users to quickly and easily find the ID of any Facebook page they're currently browsing. It's useful for developers who need to work with Facebook pages, marketers who want to track the performance of their Facebook pages, or anyone who wants to find the ID of a Facebook page for any other reason.

Once the extension is installed, simply click on the icon in your browser's toolbar while on a Facebook page. The extension will then search the page's source code for the page ID and display it in a popup window. If the page ID is not found, it will try to find it using other available options.

In addition to the page ID, the extension will also display the name of the Facebook page, making it easy to quickly identify the page you're on.

If you're looking for a simple, easy-to-use tool for finding Facebook page IDs, the Facebook Page ID Finder is the perfect solution.
